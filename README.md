# MusicSync

A script for keeping a music collection in sync across different formats and locations.

Features:
 * Compares the file lists between source and destinations. Only converts new files.
 * Converts to ALAC or MP3.


I keep my music collection in FLAC and use this script to convert files to ALAC for playing on my iPod.

Usage example:
```
./musicsync.py ~/Music/CDs ~/Music/ALAC
```
